TEST TASK FOR IGOR:

Create a bulletin uploader webpage App that interacts with our system.

See API_Reference.txt for the parts of our API that you need. Join us on Slack for any clarification you need.

STEPS
1. Show a web page that prompts the user for username and password.
2. Once the user logs in, populate a drop-down with the list of possible channels
3. Show a 'Select Image' button that allows the user to choose any JPG or PNG (no other types) from disk
4. Show the chosen image in a small (2" roughly) preview window
5. Once the preview is fully rendered, show an 'Upload' button that uses the Upload API to store on the server. Show a progress bar here.
6. Once a channel has been chosen and the image has finished uploading, enable the 'Publish' button
7. Once the user hits Publish, perform the necessary API steps to actually publish the bulletin. Then popup a new browser window that shows the published bulletin as retrieved from the server.

Real example, according to server logs

Explanation of real example:
1. User login
2. List the available channels
3. Upload the image, get its URL
4. Upload the resulting HTML bulletin, get its URL
5. Publish the URL to one of the channels
6. Get the resulting bulletin to show to the user

After step 3, within the client, embed this image URL into the supplied bulletin template dynamically
After step 5, open a new browser tab showing the bulletin, resulting in the retrieval call in step 6


This should work on an iPhone 5, 6, and 7plus in portrait mode on Safari and Chrome.
